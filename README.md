Custom Remote Scripts for use in Ableton Live

* Alesis_VI25_Custom

This is the remote script I use for my Alesis VI25 MIDI Controller. It has three additions from the default
1. I have the Knobs on Channel 1 for Preset 1 and those knobs are mapped to Device parameters.
2. I have hte Knobs on Channel 2 for Preset 2 and those knobs are mapped to track volume.
3. The bank of buttos are mapped, 1-8 Track Mute, 9-16 Track Solo, 17-24 Track Arm
